# Trained-Immunity-and-Endothelial-cell
Exploring the long noncoding RNA profiles in endothelial cells after repeated exposure with proinflammatory cytokines

## Description:
This project explores the phenomenon of trained immunity in endothelial cells by studying the impact of repeated exposure to proinflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Using primary human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVEC), the study investigates changes in gene activity and epigenetics, particularly focusing on the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) through RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq analysis.
